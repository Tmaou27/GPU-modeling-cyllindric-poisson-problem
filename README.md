# GPU-modeling-cyllindric-poisson-problem
FDM, 2d, axial symmetry, cuda, device global memory, c++, poisson equation
I wrote progamm on python on IYPT to this problem https://iypt.ru/%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%87%d0%b8/2023/4-%d1%8d%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%80/
This projects is gpu written version of that programm, what calculates potential destribution and charge on a ball
Full description of this project lies in pptx presentations
